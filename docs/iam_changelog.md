**Owner:** H. Poelenjee  
**Tech Lead:** Codex Team  
**Created:** 2025-11-01  

This file serves as both a **changelog** and a **version management ledger** for the IAM module. Every edit, insertion, or removal of code, configuration, or documentation within the IAM system must be recorded here.  
Versioning adheres to semantic style: `Major.Minor.Revision` (e.g., 1.1.1 â†’ 1.1.1 â†’ 1.2.0).

## ðŸ§© VERSIONING RULES
1. **Every modification counts** â€“ Any code insertion, deletion, or logic change triggers a version increment.
2. **Granular tracking** â€“ Each commit or deployment must reference the version number.
3. **Documentation parity** â€“ PRD, TI, and schema updates must reflect the same version.
4. **Change review** â€“ Each version must include: author, date, type (add/edit/remove), and short rationale.
5. **Release tagging** â€“ All production releases must be tagged in Git or release registry using the version ID.

---

## ðŸ§© VERSION LOG TEMPLATE
When logging a new version, append entries as follows:

```
### ðŸ§© vX.Y.Z â€“ YYYY-MM-DD
**Author:** [Name]  
**Type:** [Insert / Edit / Remove]  
**Scope:** [e.g., models.py / routes_admin.py / schema.sql / MFA logic]  
**Summary:** [Short explanation of what changed and why]
```

| v1.2.1 | Step-up MFA decorator refactor | Dec 2025 |
| v1.3.0 | Integration with Project Monitoring / Ticket System | Jan 2026 |

---

## ðŸ§© VERSION MANAGEMENT PROCESS
1. **Code Commit:** Developer completes change â†’ increments local version.
2. **Peer Review:** PR reviewed â†’ version verified in `IAM_CHANGELOG.md`.
3. **Tag & Deploy:** Git tag created â†’ deployment metadata updated.
4. **Archive:** Outdated version folder/documentation preserved for traceability.

---

## ðŸ§­ GOVERNANCE NOTES
- IAM follows **strict version discipline** for all functional and technical artifacts.
- All documentation (`PRD`, `TI`, `Schema`, `Models`, `Routes`) must reference the same version header.
- Any cross-project usage (e.g., integration into DORA Portal or Ticket System) must declare dependency version in its own changelog.
